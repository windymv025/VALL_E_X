      "twice反鼓就化了他们所以因此我想在这里我要解释的是说返古虽然接触了一束\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是他對藝術上有非常強的自我的主見他不喜歡太過華麗的、唯美的藝術\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他不喜欢太过装饰气味的贵族艺术他觉得艺术应该是以关心生命为主\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "关心生命里面最受苦的那些人所以他的画其实并不华美\n",

      "我們說過范谷的父親是閣文教派的牧師范谷的祖父是閣文教派的牧師\n",

      "因为布鲁塞尔的经验跟巴黎的经验可能不完全一样巴黎的经验跟伦敦又可能不太一样\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以这些不同的精力其实也等于培养犯蛊这个年轻的业务员将来有朝一日\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可以做總公司裏面更跨國的策劃因為我們一直要知道藝術其實是有很多環境的特質的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "比如说在台湾喜欢买的话可能跟纽约是很不一样的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以这里面的不同如果是一个大的跨国公司它就必须要适应不同的市场\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那麼所以我們看到返顧被掉來掉去其實很明顯是因為公司很重用它希望培養它去經歷不同的經驗\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "而她也的確很勝任她幾乎在每一個地方在巴黎、在倫敦\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他開了他的眼界他對歐洲18、19世紀上半葉所有的這些他的前輩的這些大師的名將\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我們幾乎看到的就是梵谷家族有一個很強烈的宗教傳統可是如果我們再放大一點尺度來看\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "滴滴確實是一個重要的基礎只是梵谷這個時候大家沒有想到因為他只覺得他只是把這個當一個職業\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "把艺术经纪公司当一个职业她没有想到有一天她会变成画家\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "而且他会变成比他卖的这些画家更有名的一个画家\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "他甚至也看到很多臨摹的偽作秉座,偽作他都能夠辨識\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "這是最好的眼力,最好的機會我們知道現在很多美術系的學生,因為沒有機會看到原作\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "比如說我們在台灣看不到真正的反骨我們看到的都是靈魔所以有一天你不知道真的是靈魔\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "真憑哪件事假的時候他可能指著假的說這是真的因為沒有眼界就是沒有真正閱歷過\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以返古這個樂歷是非常可貴對我們也特別強調\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他在古比西藝術公司的這一段的訓練非常非常的難能可貴\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因為培養了一個,他對藝術上最大的這個見賞的能力可是我必須說\n",

      "它的唯美裡面有一點脫離現實就是你會覺得安格爾的話看多了以後\n",

      "公立非常的高技巧非常好他畫一張畫要畫很久很久所以當然\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "慢工出細活那麼相對的這件作品也就是所謂的真品因為比較少有\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "最主要是我們希望用這個背景來解讀犯古在早期的畫作\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我说的早期 gaugery 的画作大概是围绕在 1880 年前后。\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "是我們現在看到的油畫像向日葵啊 或者是他的字畫\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "化相阿,顔色很亮麗的大概都是在1886年之後就是1886年\n",

      "法古去了,所以他受到了一個很不同的影響,就是巴黎的印象派的影響\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以它整個畫面忽然色彩豐富起來也亮起來可在1886年之前\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以我們也可以說《基督教的聖經》這本書其實對范谷發生了非常決定性的影響\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我们看到范谷最早,绘画对她来讲,并不是她最主要的工作\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "之前我們介紹過泛谷大概在17歲的時候他就曾經因為他叔叔的介紹\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "到古比西的藝術經紀公司裡面去做電源\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以他有機會接觸到很多買賣的藝術品包括真跡也包括很多的複製品\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以他跟藝術有了一些接觸可是我们也一再强调贩雇最早的职员\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "絕對不是做一個畫家就他有這麼好的機會在一個藝術經紀公司裡面工作\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他也很有机会自己去创作可是那个时候他好像壓根没有想到他要做画家\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因為他一心一意有一個為窮人去服務的這個理念是受他父親跟祖父影響的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因为他们家两代都是牧师所以他觉得他一直要做牧师牧师才是他生命里面\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "真正的志向所在其实不是画家这是一般人很不了解\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "這個影響不僅在犯古一個個人的身上,同時也是荷蘭當時普遍心教的一個理想。\n",

      "其實我想這個只能說是他1886年以後的反骨那1890年他就自殺了\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以事實上他真正作為畫家的這個部分比較重要是1886-1890\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "只有四年的工作 四年的工夫那麼之前他其實一直是想要做牧師\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "他從比利時牧師身份被解聘所以808182\n",

      "所以他拿起了碳筆拿起了一些很簡單的工具畫下了他們的一些\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "就是他的行為舉止不會異常可是凡古是有一點異常的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因為他不喜歡跟人應酬他不喜歡嘻嘻哈哈地講有的沒有的事情\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "跟你談生命活著的意義你也會蠻害怕的所以 也許泛古就走到自己非常孤獨的那條路\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那麼這個時候因為他曾經在十幾歲的時候就在很大的這個藝術經紀公司裡面做過店員\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以繪畫就變成他熟悉的一個題材所以因此他就走上了繪畫\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那么,当然绘画这件事,他没有受过正规的训练虽然他做过店员,买卖过艺术品\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "或者是礦工這種樹苗的作品卷起來帶去給他的堂哥莫福來看\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "然後有五個人物圍繞著這個桌子我們說有五個人圍著他\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以有一个人是背对我们的我们看到在绘画里很少人会处理完全背面的人\n",

      "可是這個人是完全背面的我們看不到他的臉我們只看到他一個背影坐在那個地方\n",

      "非常地辛苦然後用手去挖這個馬鈴薯然後晚上的時候泛古又走過去\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "然後這些農民沒有發現泛谷在屋子外面因為我們知道 他們居民住的房子都是破破爛爛的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以有很多的缝就是那个房子其实不是很高级的住宅所以那个木板跟木板之间的缝很宽\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "从门蜂里偷看他就看到一个背对他的人然后他也看到面对他的几个人\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他們現在在吃什麼樣的食物她在信裏面寫得非常詳細她很好奇這些人的生活\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "然後我就發現說 這些人整個桌子上只有一個食物就是馬鈴薯\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他没有读过美术系,他没有正规美术学院的训练,他在他的堂哥莫福那个画室里...\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "反骨非常感動\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我想意義不太一樣因為他剛好是白天看到這一家農民是用自己的手在挖馬鈴薯\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "現在他們看到這個馬鈴薯就是他們的食物所以他們是真正在土地裡勞動的人\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他们的劳动就是他们的养活自己的一种方法\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "這個是梵谷想要畫的東西它要告訴我們說自食其力的某一種尊嚴\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我吃的米麵大概都不會是我自己種的可是對於, 相信聖經的飯谷來講\n",

      "生活他們是字時起立的那我們今天已經很難了解字時起立四個字的真正的莊嚴的意義\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以他有一點想把吃馬鈴薯的人畫成一張非常莊嚴的宗教繪畫\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我們談到了泛古在1885年\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "最重要的一件作品叫做吃馬鈴薯的人我們介紹了\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "半谷,可能躲在一个村落非常穷困的农村一个破烂的小房子旁边\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "透過那些木板的縫隙看到了一家人\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "圍坐在一起 吃晚餐的樣子所以它給我們一個非常真實的感覺\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那麼這五個人圍坐在餐桌上幾乎像西方繪畫史上\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "最重要的一個題材叫做 最後的晚餐最後的晚餐是耶穌最後一次\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所谓的净物就是说 放一颗玻璃菜 大白菜放几个马铃薯\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "按定时辞假之前跟他的12个门徒一起吃晚餐有面包、有红酒\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是現在返股看到五個農民圍在一個桌子前面只有馬鈴薯\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他會覺得這是一個真正聖經的題材這是一個真正信仰者的題材\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他們甚至在勞動了一天之後只有馬鈴薯可以吃可是范古說\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他們還是低頭禱告感謝神給予他們食物帕谷在最窮的人身上\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "看到了最高的道德在最穷的人世上看到了一種真正的信仰\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他會覺得在大城市當中在阿姆斯特丹、在海爬這些有錢人的生活裡\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "信仰已经变成了口头上的一种很虚浮的语言甚至在教堂里面讲着漂亮的话\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是,没有办法在生活里实践他反而看到了这群人,真正在实践一种仪式\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以我自己覺得吃馬鈴薯的人有一點像宗教的儀式宗教的儀式是說\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "紅蘿蔔然後你來練習做油畫的素描那麼去把這些畫畫下來\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "大家都記得最後的晚餐的故事耶穌當時 拿起了一個麵包\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "然後就把麵包掰了一塊掰了一塊以後他就把麵包傳下去他跟他的弟子們說\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "你們每個人分一塊這就是我的身體現在我們看到\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "很有趣 在這裡馬鈴薯 是所有這些人他們要吃的東西其實好像是他們自己的生命的一部分\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他們把所有的生命血汗都在田地裡勞動最後得到的這一盤馬鈴薯\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以我覺得這張畫,如果大家注意到有兩個人物是非常吸引人的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "一個是側面的一個男子這個側面的男子頭上戴了一個藍色的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "一個扁扁的帽子然後身上穿了一件藍色的粗布衣服很顯然是一個當時\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "19世紀末、歐洲的工人或農民的打扮然後臉黑黑髒髒的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我想一天都在田地裡面勞動的人當然不會是皮膚白白細細的那一種\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "懂得怎么调色,那么懂得怎么去打底稿,怎么去做构图。可是范固本身......\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "西方的繪畫過去就一直在畫那種皮膚很白很紅潤的人物\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那么范古把他的人物转到了另外一种就是土地里面的劳动人民\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以這個男子側面坐在那個地方他的手好像在指著馬鈴薯\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "然後旁邊有一個女人這個女人頭上有一個荷蘭很常常看到的白色的頭巾\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因為他們該工作的時候習慣戴一個白布的一個頭巾把頭髮包起來\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "這個女人好像是拿著X字她正在分馬鈴薯她好像是這一家的主婦\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "它負責要把這個馬鈴薯其實我們一看就知道5個人吃大概分量不太夠\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那麼它要把這個馬鈴薯分給每一個人分得非常公平那麼這個時候它有一點\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "好像停下來他不知道怎麽辦不知道是不是因為馬鈴薯不夠這麽少的馬鈴薯\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "怎么够分呢?他就看着可能是她丈夫的这个男人那么她们在交换 一个\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "的人因為他對於人的關心那種狂熱所以他其實有時候\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "非常奇特的眼神我覺得這個眼神裡面在傳達一種生活上的辛苦\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "就是怎麼辦那我們只有馬鈴薯我們只有這麼一點點東西那我們要怎麼分\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "也可能是說,那我們就分吧!我們就只有這一點食物,那我們每個人少吃一點\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "本來每天都不太吃得飽那我們就分一點這樣的馬鈴薯我覺得反骨的話\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "中文字幕剪輯소裃君\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "繪畫裡是沒有語言的可是不知道為什麼很多人都覺得吃馬鈴薯的人這張畫\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "有點像個戲劇好像我們可以聽到這些人在講話好像他們中間\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "有一些语言 他们好像在交谈一样如果大家手头上有泛古的画册\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我想可以細細地看這裡面的一種非常奇特的人的表情跟關係\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "特別是這個女人眼睛瞪得很大我覺得這個瞪得大大的眼睛而且手拿著一個叉子\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "好像不在意那个技巧在上一个单元当中我们特别介绍他两张很重要的素描\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "她本來正有一個動作可是停下來不做了那不做而看男人的時候\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "当然里面有一种,讯问的意思就是说,怎么办我们要怎么分这个马林苏\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "如果这是他从门缝里偶然看到的一个家庭的景象那么他当时是玩著\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可以換擁了 phrases開發象徑配合問題那你看他們都是我相真地寫的是這些在 Absolutelyír不同的第三組一直在以來都快要掉 Autumn在~~有新的材料你會看到有了不同的 組織\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "屋頂上很暗很暗可是吊著一盞煤油燈大概這個煤油燈\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "是唯一的一個光量所以這個畫面整個四面全部是被黑暗籠罩\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那麼一張是跪在搖籃前的小女孩一張是cm這個憂愁\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因為我們知道窮人的房子在入夜以後在晚上的時候當然他們很珍惜能源\n",

      "我記得連我們小的時候能關燈就關燈了因為覺得那個電費很貴\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以这里面其实是因为贫穷所以整个房子非常的暗\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "其實真的跟以前很不同因為你到哪裏都是電燈很亮的非常的亮\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因為大家好像比較富有了所以不會覺得過去的生活\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那麼暗一家人這麼大一個屋子他真的就只有那一盞燈\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "而那盞灯也就照亮着刚好在灯底下的那一盘的马铃薯\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以這個畫面裡在整個的暗色調裡面最亮的部分一個是燈一個是馬鈴薯\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "在房间的石膏像上面或在人的脸上在流动然后他们看到\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那因此這一張反骨的吃馬鈴薯的人也是優惠的光\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是我们要知道说,巴黎这个时候变成欧洲最大的一个大都会\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "如果是大都會,它一定有一個特性,不是一個只強調本土的城市。\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "这个国家到底是个什么样的国家他们不知道但他们充满了好奇充满了对日本的梦想\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "你就觀察一般的人家裡掛的某些話如果這些話都是很本土的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "表示這個城市還不是大都會因為它強調我是一個接受多元文化的人\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因此我有時候會覺得可能在台灣我們還沒有看到一個城市足夠被稱為大都會\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我們基本上太強調太多的本土所以我們沒有一個國際的vision一個國際的視野\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是如果大家看唐吉老爹這張畫可以看到1886年對於反古來講\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "凡古本來也是一個荷蘭畫家可是現在他到了巴黎他並不是法國畫家\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他要變成國際畫家了梵谷今天是世界上最有名的畫家我們不會說\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以乾乾瘦瘦的1886年以前他看到的生命現象都是辛苦的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他只是荷蘭画家或者法国画家因为在他的画里他大量吸收了\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "東方的元素他很喜歡日本版畫他就把唐吉老狄他要畫這個模特兒\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他说你坐在那边后面就挂的都是日本版画所以这张画我特别要解释\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "就是說裡面有很多返古剛剛到巴黎的藝文化的因素在裡面\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "接下來我就要介紹唐吉老爹是誰為什麼他的名字叫Dunkey後面要加一個\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "我們現在從梵谷到巴黎 1886 年往前推1871 年\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "就15年前巴黎發生過一次很重要的示威運動叫做人民公社\n",

      "就是工人跟农民上街头去跟政府的军队打仗我们在历史上叫做巴黎共識\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "都是痛苦的,都是壓抑和封閉的所以他的作品也都在很誠實的\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "抗議政府經濟政策的不當所以唐吉老爹就參加了巴黎共識\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我們知道當時參加巴黎公社以後就被抓了所以他就關到監牢裏去本來大概要判死罪的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "放出來以後唐吉老爹他對政府還是很不滿他就在蒙瑪特開了一個小文具店\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "表達這樣的一個人生的現象那麼到1886年之後我們看到\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "賣油畫顏料 賣畫筆 賣畫布然後他自己很喜歡藝術\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "然後這個時候我們就看到高庚、羅特列克、梵谷都跟他買畫布\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "買畫筆 買顏料可是我們剛才講過這些畫家很窮常常付不起錢\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "這個唐吉老爹就常說沒關西因為他就是革命黨革命黨就說\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "所以返古最恨的就是唐吉老爹的這個太太所以這些是他傳記里很有趣的東西\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是我要講這個故事的原因是說反骨忽然碰到了一群人像我們講到\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "临古酒馆的老板娘像唐吉老爹这种人不是工人不是农民\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "得到了非常多的朋友友誼的溫暖那麽這個是我覺的對他的畫風\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "最大最大的影響可是 還有一點是 我們下一個單元特別要提的當時1886年剛好發生了一個新印象主義的話判\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那么这个新印象主义里面很重要的一位领导者叫秀娜是反谷的好朋友\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以我們下一個單元會特別提到反谷在點描畫派的筆觸上是受到新印象主義的影響\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "這個時候迪奧他就到了最大的藝術經紀公司做這個藝術經紀公司\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "美得沉思我是蔣旭\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "是在巴黎的一個分公司的負責人那麽因此他弟弟在這邊賣畫賣得不錯\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那麼在整個的商業行為上也有很多的收入所以他就寫信給范谷\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "給他自己最關心的哥哥說你要不要來巴黎 住在我這邊\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "至少房租也省了然后这边有很多的画家因为迪奥是做绘画的经济买卖的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以他就跟他哥哥說你喜歡畫畫你可以透過我的關係認識很多的畫家\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "很多藝術家的朋友因為 floods 之前一再受打擊包括教會\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "包括生活周遭幾乎最後沒有朋友了它變成一個很孤獨的一個個人\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "有很多的尊敬因為他們透過了藝術呼喚起大家對人的同情\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "就是用一個小點在畫布裡面把光,跟色彩分析成色譜\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "有一本書翻開來裡面就有色譜這個色譜就是把太陽的光分成橙紅 黃綠 藍 錠紫\n",

      "那麼這七種顏色構成了所謂的光譜或者色譜當時修拉因為他們受到了一些\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "光學理論的影響他們讀了一些科學上的報告他們知道了光學光當中有紅、橙、黃、綠、藍定辭光當中有紅、橙、黃、綠、藍定辭光當中有紅、橙、黃、綠、藍定辭\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以他們就用這7種顏色來做點描的方法來畫畫等於是一種科學的分析\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那麼這種畫派叫點苗畫派因為它上面有很多一點一點的像小小的雨點\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那麼到1886年後 到了巴黎我們特別明顯的是看到在1887年這一年對法本來講特別地重要因為\n",

      "一樣在畫布上的感覺所以我們就稱他為點描畫派而當時也有一個批評家叫費內翁\n",

      "非內翁那非內翁他是個非常敏感的人他當時就寫了評論潭秀拉的話\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他說在1886年之後點描畫派一旦出現印象主義就是原來最主流的最紅的這個畫派\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "就不再是主流了他说应该要加一个post rich或者nail就是新印象主义\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "或者後印象主義那麼意思說1874年由末內所建立的印象主義已經過世了\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "经过12年到了1886年有了一个新的划判所以他在印象主义impressionism这个字前面加ne\n",

      "NEo就是我们拉丁文系统里面后来演变成英文的NEW就是新印象主义\n",

      "你可以翻开它1887年的作品你可以看到它画蒙马特的风景前面有一条宽广的马路后面有一些房子\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "情人的黃襯衫因為黃色是最高明度在視覺上我們注意黃色有一種警戒的作用\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因为它是视觉上最容易看到的颜色所以大家有没有发现红绿灯里面黄色是警戒灯\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "就是從綠燈變紅燈或者紅燈轉綠燈的時候它有一個過渡就是黃燈因為它是警告就是說我們的速度要改變\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "或者我們車子,比如我們開車,車子尾巴後面要打的這個方向燈\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "他當時在巴黎已經是一個小有名氣的藝術經紀商人古筆西藝術經紀公司\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "最明亮 它是明度最高的所以如果一個畫家畫面開始用大量的黃色\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我們就會發現這個畫家這個時候在心情上喜悅或者慷奮的狀況\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以我們特別希望大家能夠分析一下範谷在1887年的畫作\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "的确我们也看到这一段时期范古的话改变非常非常的大\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是日本比較古典的繪畫上提詩的話通常是用所謂的漢字就是牽句來提詞\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因為他原來在巴黎在1887年受到點描畫派的影響他的畫面的點是很小的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "碎碎的 一點一點的感覺可到阿爾以後因為他把畫家立在麥田當中\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "你会看到车子这样开过去有时候一个小时你看到外面的风景\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "都是向日葵那這個向日葵是一種花對於當地的農民來講\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "它并不只是为了观赏花,是因为葵花,它的瓜子可以炸油。\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那範鼓是不懂漢文的它不會中文可是我們看他在這裡\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "它是一種經濟產品所以就大片大片的像日葵的甜可是所有的朋友\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我記得看到這樣的景象都會驚叫起來因為真的就是梵谷看到的景象\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "這是在巴黎看不到的因為你會看到亮麗的陽光底下一大堵一大堵的向日葵\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "黄色的然后他们都面向着太阳他们的方向完全随着太阳在转\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以我想范古那時候也感動到說陽光是有這麼大的吸引力的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "這麼遙遠的一個太陽可以讓地球上的植物在仰望它的光跟熱\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "而燃燒起来他的生命的热情所以我觉得这里面有一点在象征范古自己在找这个热情\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他在找passion找生命裡面最能夠燃燒他的力量\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以他就不断画向日葵而因此他在画向日葵的时候他的笔触就变得非常狂野\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "不再是秀拉的很碎細的點描所以這一點我特別要解釋\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "這裡是IC-GINFM97.5\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "一笔一笔用油画笔模仿书法的感觉写了两排的字出来\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "就是因為 我們都知道一個畫家一定要找到自己的風格\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "自己的style可是1887年我們看到范古有一段時間的話\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "非常非常的像秀拉甚至可以说是模仿秀拉所以如果是这样子的话\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "《饭鼓》很容易掉到一個模仿他人的陷阱裡一個畫家絕對不會\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因為模仿他人而成名的因為你永遠只是做別人的第二\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以范古很快地在阿爾就找到了他自己擺脫了他在巴黎受到的欺負\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "其他画家的影响而用那种粗犷的狂野筆触画出了真正的反骨\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以我自己觉得真正的范谷 其实是88年、89年、90年只有三年\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "她完成了3年的風格她就自殺走丟所以其實我們也是很心痛覺得這個畫家\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "一直在摸索自我風格摸索到1888年一直到她阿爾的時候她才真正完成了她自己\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那么所以这一张画是历史上非常重要的一个见证许多人用它来说明\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以这也是为什么我们特别要强调阿尔对 Falcon 的重要就是如果他没有来阿尔\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "它很可能在巴黎被其他人的画风会淹没掉我们谈到了1888年\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "大概到9月的時後我們看到范古的心情達到了一個狂喜的巔峰\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因为他知道高功终于答应他要来了所以他就开始整理房间\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "如他那时候住在一个租来的一个我们叫黄色房屋因为那个房屋的外面\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "是黃色的油漆然後他在二樓的地方范谷租了兩個房子\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那一个是他的画室可是后来他就把这个画室准备出来给高根迎接高根\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他為了迎接高跟做的事情有時候我們都覺得不可思議就是好我們有一個好朋友\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可能要从乡下来 或从国外回来我们为它准备一个房间我们看到饭股可以是\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "日以繼夜地去準備這個房間他把房間的牆壁上\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "作為一個西方畫家的反骨,對於東方文化的一種嚮往。\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "一點一點畫了像壁紙一樣的花為了迎接她最好的朋友所以我們看到她\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "把所有生命里面最大的快乐寄望在高更的来临也许它寂寞到了\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "也許他孤獨到了極點他覺得只要高更來可以解決所有他的寂寞跟孤獨\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以其實我想我們就已經有點擔心就是這樣的一種狂熱的對人的寄望\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可能范谷会掉到另外一个幻灭里我们看到他画了很多的向日葵插在瓶子里的向日葵\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他说要把向日葵的画送给高根好像他觉得高根就是他的太阳\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "它就是那一朵向日葵它不斷的去仰望那個太陽然後太陽可以給它光跟熱\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以我想高庚其實並不了解因為他們跟范鼓的相處其實時間並不長\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "在巴黎也只有一年高跟有一點大拉拉的人\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "並沒有注意到細節其實我們看到范谷可能有一些精神上的躁鬱的問題已經發生了\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那么这里也说明19世纪的时候透过放股有一个新的世界文化将要出来\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可能要發病我們知道這種躁躍的病可能在不同的嚴陵會爆發\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "就它所谓的造症就是特别地亢奋特别的Hot特别的狂袭起来\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "就比如高更要来就很兴奋很兴奋的准备所有的事情那其次我们知道欲欲症\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "忽然掉到一个很深的低谷,情绪的低潮,它是落差很大。\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以也因爲泛谷後來精神病里學上特別對照證跟育政\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "做了很多的研究因為飯古是第一個重要的個案所以那時候他一直在準備\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "最高跟要来吗 高跟是10月到22所以它个9月的时候他那个狂喜\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "興奮已經到了完全不能控制的狀況然後高更來了\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他當然很高興跟他一起畫畫可是很快的我們就會發現兩個人共同生活\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "其實是非常不容易的他們當時有點在實驗一種像公社一樣的生活\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因為在販股之前大家都流行說,東方是東方,西方是西方\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "就是兩個人住在一起然後他們有的錢比如說高庚有一點錢或者梵谷他弟弟會寄點錢給他\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他們就丟在一個罐子裡然後大家一起用我的意思說我們今天如果有一個室友\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我们大概经济还是独立的可是贩股跟高更好到什么程度它们觉得经济可以一起用\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以不在乎對方從罐子裡拿多少錢所以每天買菜的錢都從罐子裡拿\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那后来 高根写了一个很有趣的诗他们是成年的男人\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "男人有生理上的需要所以有時候他們要去祭願那個錢也都在罐子裏拿\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是後來就開始吵架了因為高根會抱怨范古說你怎麼煮湯的時候\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "連鹽料都煮進去因為她在畫畫大概不精心所以那個鹽料就掉到湯裡\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "就煮了一鍋的南瓜湯就變成藍色了高根就很生氣說這個湯怎麼喝\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "然後范谷也跟他吵架范谷說你最近去那個妓院的次數太多了那個錢都給你花掉了\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "東方西方永遠不碰頭有這樣的一個俗語可是我們看到到了梵谷的時代\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以他们两个就开始一直吵架所以我也觉得这件事情其实说明我们最好的朋友\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "其實有一種友誼的狂喜可是當共同生活其實是非常現實的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因為共同生活裡面的柴米油鹽醬醋茶其實包括夫妻都常常為非常非常的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "小小一點瑣碎的是吵架所以你就可以想像這兩個個性都這麼強烈的人\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "當然最後一定爆發吵架這件事所以我想這一段時期其實飯鼓流下最動人的話\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "是兩把椅子有一把椅子是高跟的椅子我們知道高跟的椅子\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "是范古特别为它做的有把手就是你坐下来有两个抚手\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "那高根常常坐在這個椅子上點一支蠟燭然後看書 ketchup\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他看到 dieser椅子是空的高跟走了然后范古就把高跟看的书放在椅子上\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "然後黃蠟燭也放在椅子上然後畫了這一張椅子我覺得這椅子的意思是說\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "其實東方西方在碰頭了所以我們看到范古會去模仿日本浮世繪版畫\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "如果今天有個好朋友我很愛的人來我家然後她坐在那個椅子上然後過一會她走了\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我大概會看那個椅子看很久覺得椅子上還留著他的體溫範谷為什麼會畫椅子\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因为很少画家画椅子可是这个椅子让你感觉到范古对高亨的那种\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "依賴,就覺得這是她在人世間大概唯一可以懂她心事的朋友\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是爲什麽現在好像又跟他保持了一種距離有點隔閡然後泛國又畫了自己的椅子\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他的椅子很簡單沒有扶手就是最簡單的一個椅子然後上面有一個煙斗\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "有一包它抽烟的烟丝那我就觉得如果你比较这两把椅子你会感觉到饭骨\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "好渴望有朋友可是没有朋友了因为高根可能故意再躲他\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以到了1888年的12月24號就是聖誕夜的晚上高庚不敢回家\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因为他觉得他这个朋友有点精神病了就是常常会发怒常常会吼叫\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "会模仿东方的书法那同一个时间我们看到罗丹大雕刻家\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是事後又跟他道歉又哭其實是躁鬱的病已經在發那高根很害怕\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "不敢回家 就在路上乱逛那么冷我们看看12月已经很冷了\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "她就听到有人在跟踪她后面有脚步声她就很害怕一回头看是反顾\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "梵谷就一直在跟著他高庚走一走 他意不欲屈地跟著走\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我们就可以了解到高根一定心里非常的恐惧不晓得怎么回事过一会他又仔细地看\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他发现范古手上拿了一把刀是剃头发的剃刀所以他就更害怕\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "也曾經畫過柬埔寨的很多舞者高棉的舞者的舞蹈那我們也看到音樂上的德布西\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "幻聽,就是他的耳朵旁邊一直有聲音所以他很痛苦他大概要傷害自己\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是高庚以為他要傷害高庚所以其實我們就會發現一個精神病的朋友\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "你不了解他你也救不了他那范古就割了他的耳朵那麽這件事情引發了高跟部\n",

      "所以這裡面都說明西方當時很多前衛的藝術家對東方有非常非常大的嚮往\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是在這個嚮往過了之後我們看到范古在巴黎有一段時間\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "很兴奋 认识了很多新朋友 非常的快乐他跟秀拉学点描画派的画法\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "可是去幫助很多窮困這種牛肉廠的這種被人家看不起的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "平面的繪畫其實是比較溫和的可是當它一旦變成立體的雕塑的時候\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "它有一種很強烈的感覺尤其上面一打光以後這個雕塑就會產生立體的光影出來\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "它是三度空间的立体的这种我们叫做脚椎体有点椎体的那个美\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "這些部分是可能,還沒有看過原話的朋友有時候比較不容易理解\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "好像他睡觉都睡不着了我们叫做害过头了就是亢奋过头的时候他是没有办法安静睡觉的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "因此,我們一方面心疼這個話家,覺得說,他可不可以不要發病?\n",

      "一個是向日葵一個是自畫像對我自己來講因為我也畫畫\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以我會覺得一個畫家所有的畫作不管是風景、鏡物\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "其實都在畫自己因為其實劃家在畫畫的過程當中雖然比如說泛古在面對著向日葵\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "向日葵裡面他所要表達的黃色那種光那種熱\n",

      "其實是他的熱情 是他的Passion是他的內在世界的某一種糾纏\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "已經到了精神病馬上要爆發就他在畫這個畫的時候還沒有精神病爆發\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因為它是到1888年的12月精神病才爆發\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是我们看到8月9月10月11月的字画像已经感觉到它one by one濒临崩溃的边缘\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是精神醫療學告訴我們說任何醫生的病例表其實都比不上半股的自華像\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因為范谷的自畫像是比別人更深刻地對自己的分析我想跟朋友交換一個意見\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "就是 范古是個精神病人我們今天無可否認他後來因為被關在精神病院治療他是一個精神病人\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "可是千万不要忘记泛谷同时也是自己的医生他在画画的时候同时在治疗自己\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "很多人都发现范古画画的时候非常安静就是不管她多么狂暴的个性躁躍并发到什么程度\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他在画画的过程当中非常非常的安静所以因此现在很多的精神医疗学\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "也都用繪畫來做躁鬱病的治療我就曾經參觀過像台大醫院的這個躁鬱病方面的治療\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "有點遙遠了所以我想用這個例子解釋梵谷在1888年2月到了阿爾以後\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "他們還出過劃冊的就是其實我們很難解釋一個人當她在發病的過程當中\n",

      "因此,我想范古同時扮演了病人的角色,也同時扮演了醫生的角色。\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "而它的自化像也提供給人類第一次對於躁鬱病這樣的一個精神病的領域\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "有點很幽默地嘲笑自己調侃自己的感覺所以在他22章的自畫下\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "這是唯一最平靜的一張因為今天的精神醫療界也認為\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "是因為他耳朵裡面有幻聽的現像就是精神病的病人有時候\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "像魔鬼一樣折磨他的那個聲音趕走所以這段時期是它最平靜的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "有的時候也提醒我們是不是我們自己的狂熱、慷憤,在極度夢想裡面的一種渴望。\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "有一段時間,它反而得到了平常沒有得到的寧靜。我們談到了1890年,\n",

      "一月的范古范古的生命已經到了最後他在1890年的7月27號自殺\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "29號去世所以它只剩下了半年的生命可是我們看到\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "直到在1890年的時候梵谷經過一整年的精神治療\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "還能捍衛病人在當中他就每天不能出去每天面對著一個小小的窗口\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",

      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "來度過最困難的這個時刻事實上\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我想很多朋友都知道在那個年代1889-1890的時候\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "其实根本没有我们今天的所谓的精神医疗学因为大家对于精神病的领域\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以可能医生也只是把他关在那边也不晓得怎么处理\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "也沒有一定可以治療的藥物也沒有可以治療的方法所以犯故等於..\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "是自己在治疗自己那治疗自己的方法其实就是创作它在长期的创作当中\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "得到了非常驚人的一種情緒上的抒情\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以世界的精神医疗会议常常为了这一年的贩户\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "开了很多会议讨论他的画作我们知道这一年当中他画了将近两千张画\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "這個可能立刻掉落下來就會陷落住一種精神的憂鬱狀態\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "這是一般人不太可能達到的數目。我們可以講說\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "一年不過三百多天那他一天可能要畫三張畫四張畫\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "入到五章話才能構成所謂的2000,這樣的一年的數字。\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因此在這段時期 我們看看他的畫作達到了一個驚人的創作\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "能量而且每一张画都非常非常的精彩我们也看到这个时候的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "几乎完全不管所谓的学院里面画派的纪法油画对他来讲\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "只是一個表現的工具而已它可以把濃厚的顏料大量的堆疊在畫簿上\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "構成像雕塑一樣的質感讓色彩非常的艷麗、非常的強烈\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "因此大概我們站在他這段時期的化作前面\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "我們都深不由己會被他的畫作裏面那種強烈的情緒所感染\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "所以大概在10月的時候因為高更到了阿爾跟范古住在一起\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
      "甚至會熱淚盈眶所以我們看到他最典型的這一段時期的\n",
      "Detected language: zh\n",
